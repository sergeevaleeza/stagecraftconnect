# StageCraft Connect — Landing Page

This repository contains the static landing page for **StageCraft Connect**, an early-stage research and pilot initiative exploring how touring and regional performance productions find trusted local costume and wardrobe support in unfamiliar cities.

The site currently serves as:
- A public-facing project overview
- An entry point to a production-focused survey
- A credibility anchor for outreach and grant applications

## Current Status
- No application or platform has been built yet
- Matching and coordination are being explored through research and pilot planning
- Technology decisions will be informed by survey findings and pilot results

## Purpose
Touring productions frequently rely on local professionals for alterations, emergency fixes, dressers, wigs, accessories, and related support — yet finding trusted help in new cities can be time-consuming and stressful.

StageCraft Connect is researching this problem space to:
- Understand how often local support is needed
- Identify points of friction in current workflows
- Determine which cities are best suited for an initial pilot

## What This Repo Includes
- `index.html` — static landing page hosted via GitHub Pages
- Inline CSS and JavaScript for layout and visual presentation

## What This Repo Does NOT Include
- Backend services
- User accounts or data storage
- Marketplace functionality

Those elements will be considered only after research and pilot validation.
